## View and Analyze Fixed Income Fund Returns

The NAV (price) of fixed income and money market funds fluctuate daily.
For the best yield, it would be good to buy at the end of a downturn in daily yield
and possibly sell or switch-out when the daily yield is above the trend for some days.

Macro factors can affect the daily returns in the short term. Most notable are an
unexpected change in interest rates or a change in *expectation* of a rate cut or hike
by the central bank.

This repo contains some Python and Jupyter code to get data for Thai M.M. or F.I. funds
and view return trends in a Jupyter Notebook.

Planned work is to create an app to test strategies for buy/sell/switch to see if
a more profitable strategy than "buy and hold" can be found.
